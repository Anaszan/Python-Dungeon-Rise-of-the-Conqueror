// Dungeon lighting. The levels are unlit by design — see GameScene, which
// carries no scene-wide light at all. Everything a player can see is inside
// one of two pools of light: the lantern they carry (Player.tsx) and the
// torches standing in the level (DungeonProps' Torch).
//
// DECAY is deliberately softer than the physically-correct 2. Light landing
// on a floor is scaled by the cosine of its angle, which at ground level
// falls off hard with distance on its own; stacking true inverse-square on
// top of that gives a blown-out hot spot at the player's feet ringed by
// almost nothing. Pulling the exponent down spreads the same light into the
// broad, readable circle this is meant to be, at the cost of being physically
// fictional — which is the right trade for a lantern in a game.
//
// RADIUS is the hard cutoff where three.js windows the light to zero; the
// pool reads as fading out well before it, at roughly half that distance.
//
// The numbers below were picked by working the whole chain through — three's
// distance attenuation, the floor's albedo, ACES tone mapping, sRGB encode —
// and reading off the resulting pixel values across the pool. The lantern
// lands around 140/255 under the player, is still comfortably readable out at
// 4-5 units, and has gone black by 8. Unlit floor sits at 2/255.
